    <h1>August Events</h1>
    <p>August 25th: I also had a pop at the jumping puzzle near the start and boy did it frustrate the bejesus out of me! I What I enjoyed the most and felt most confirmed in, is the overall feel of the game: the atmosphere, the large scale world, the music and art, and of course the classes and races which I find, for the most part very accomplished and fun to play. I was pleasantly surprised that the content was not as difficult to complete as I had supposed. A Hurricane battlecruiser and Buzzard are on d-scan in C2a, along with a tower, but I see no wrecks and no anomalies.</p>
    <p>August 28th: Out of all the tests over the last few months that was the one where, finally, everything came together, coalesced into a feeling of understanding that allowed me to really, truly, enjoy the game. This probably is the most 'normal' character of the three. For instance, SWTOR has over 200,000 lines of spoken dialogue, as verified by Guinness World Records. What I do feel qualified to spend a little bit of time talking about is how your mana and spells feel before you enter a raid environment. I first discovered Lordaeron as a fledgling warrior, prone to wearing mail and even leather because I knew almost nothing about my class, while questing.</p>
    <p>August 30th: Oh and soon after that, I managed to get Zen Master Archaeologist. As the Horde offensive progresses, Alliance casualties will be sent back to progressively higher levels – first E/W, then South, then the Courtyard. I’ve decided to go down the Blades and Pistols route and am going for the Paladin deck as that seems to suit my play-style pretty well. Given the way things work out, I guess we're looking at late August for the pre-release patch. This time, ArenaNet decided to finally give us a glimpse on the final two races, Sylvari and Asura. You see, I was a gamer girl before the term existed and opportunities to play female characters in video games were rare, especially in fantasy/adventure type games.</p>
